# Social-Network-Graph-Link-Pridiction

This project focuses on predicting connections between users in a social network graph. Given a dataset with information about user connections, the goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict whether a link will exist between two users based on their attributes and network characteristics.

## Project Overview

- The dataset used for training and evaluation contains information about user connections in a social network graph.
- Each data entry consists of two fields: "user1" and "user2", indicating whether there is a connection between user1 and user2 (1 if connected, 0 if not connected).
- Various features can be derived from the dataset, such as user attributes (e.g., age, gender), network properties (e.g., common friends, mutual interests), and any additional contextual information available.
- Machine learning algorithms, such as supervised classifiers or graph-based models, are applied to learn patterns from the data and predict connections between users.
- The performance of the model is evaluated using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score.

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing: The project includes steps to clean, preprocess, and transform the dataset into a suitable format for machine learning algorithms.
- Feature engineering: Relevant features are derived from the dataset to capture user attributes and network characteristics that may influence the presence of connections.
- Model selection and training: Different machine learning models, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or graph-based models (e.g., graph neural networks), can be explored and evaluated.
- Evaluation and metrics: The performance of the trained models is assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score.
- Visualization: The project may include visualizations of the social network graph, predicted connections, or other relevant insights.
